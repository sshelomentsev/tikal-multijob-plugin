<div>
    Define how to decide the status of the whole MultiJob Phase, based on the status of current job. <br>
    <b>Never</b> Usual behaviour: if this Job is Failed or Unstable, MultiJob Phase will have Failed status.
    <b>Stable or Unstable but not Failed</b> If status of this phase is Unstable the MultiJob Phase will have Success status still.
    <b>Always</b> The same as previous mode, but Failed status will be ignored for MultiJob Phase status too.
